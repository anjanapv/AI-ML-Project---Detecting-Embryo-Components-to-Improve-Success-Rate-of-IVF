Capstone Group Project

The most prevalent fertility procedure, in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), has never attained its full potential. A systematic selection of embryos with the best implementation potential is a key step in improving IVF efficacy. The embryologist assesses the viability of the embryo by manually examining its components under a microscope. Semantic segmentation can discover critical components of human embryos for computational analysis, thanks to the success of deep learning in the medical diagnosis sector. Manual evaluation of embryo components is a critical activity that necessitates close monitoring by embryologists; although, this process may be automated using AI-based algorithms.
